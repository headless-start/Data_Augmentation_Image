# Image Augmentation with TensorFlow  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project demonstrates the impact of **image augmentation techniques** on model performance by training a neural network on the MNIST dataset. Key comparisons include model accuracy and generalization with/without augmentation.  

**Dataset**: MNIST.  
**Goal**: Evaluate how augmentation improves robustness and reduces overfitting in general Image classification tasks.

## 🚀 Key Features  
1. **Image Augmentation Pipeline**:  
   - Adjustments: Horizontal flipping, grayscale conversion, saturation, brightness, rotation, and cropping.  
   - Real-time augmentation using TensorFlow’s `tf.image` module.  
2. **Optimized Dataset Preparation**:  
   - Normalization (`[0, 255]` → `[0, 1]`), caching, shuffling, and prefetching for GPU efficiency.  
3. **Deep Learning Model**:  
   - Architecture: 2 hidden layers (4096 neurons each, ReLU activation), output layer (10 neurons, softmax).  
   - Trained separately on augmented vs. raw data for performance comparison.
